      Hey, welcome to my website! 
      Here you can find some examples of work I've done in the past, both marketing-related and some coding work I've done in my path to learning web development.
      You can also check out the certifications I've earned throughout my career and take a gander at my resume by clicking the links below. 
      Lastly, I'm still pretty new to coding, so if there's anything buggy or confusing on this site, please let me know! 
      Or just assume that I'm working on some experiments and ignore them. Thanks, hope to talk to you soon!
